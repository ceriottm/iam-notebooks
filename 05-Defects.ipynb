Defects can have a large impact on the electronic properties of a material, drive transport of ions, and are often related to solid-state transformations. \n",

The process is illustrated schematically below: a dislocation along the $(1\\bar{1}0)$ directions corresponds to removal of _two_ $(110)$ lattice planes. The large deformation of the lattice can be accommodated by forming a pair of partial dislocations (that correspond to a single missing plane each) that are separated by a stacking fault region.\n",
